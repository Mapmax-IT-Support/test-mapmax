<p>In contrast to commercial space, most residential users prefer a location that is quiet, safe and not on a busy road, street or avenue. The main considerations in the RETONE, 
a propriety software developed in order to illustrate the community surrounding a location, is that there is transportation close-by, retailers like supermarkets, pharmacies and restaurants easily accessible, 
and points of interest like schools, places of worship, and recreational facilities such as parks and gyms. The proximity of doctors, dentists and veterinarians is also important to know. 
The RETONE community is especially key. For example, a family with young children may want to find a community where there are many other young children in the neighborhood for their kids to befriend. 
Whereas, a young professional person may want to live in a community with many other your professional people.</p>

<p>Study the RETONE geography surrounding your potential new home in order to understand the diversity and strength of your community and the see the transportation, 
shopping and services available in your neighborhood.</p>

    export const RETOMEModalBody = <p>“RETONE” is a proprietary software outlining the community’s primary shopping district.
        It is designated in gray overlay on the mapping page when selected. RETONE digitally computes travel time and distance to establish an area from which the majority of
        retail customers are most likely to come. In order for a small business to be successful, RETONE should reveal demographics of a customer base likely to buy your product.
        For example, if you are selling baby products, you will want a large population of new families with babies in your RETONE.

            weekday morning turnstiles counts- will be an advantage for selling coffee. </p>
        <p>Additionally, the demographics of people who live and work in the RETONE have the highest potential to become customers throughout the day and weekend</p>

        types of businesses in your shopping district, your location should have higher visibility,
        and be more easily accessible than the neighboring competition. Your product should also be of better quality and sold at competitive price point.

   export  const summaryModalBody = <p>
        When accessing a potential location’s viability look at the RETONE demographics. Study the maps and satellite images with the RETONE overlay carefully.
        Study the space and building structure and landscape around the site. Take note of the land’s topography and natural barriers like rivers, lakes and parks.
        Be aware that customers may be reluctant to cross over barriers to shop. Look over businesses and points of interest that can generate customers to you also and those that may compete
        to take away customer dollars. Analyze strengths and weaknesses within the RETONE, along with the location’s individual merits of store layout,
        visibility and accessibility and your educated analysis will help you choose the best location that you can afford with a much higher likeliness of success. Good luck!
